// Debounce is like saying:
// "I’ll wait until you’re done talking. Then I’ll answer you."



// 📦 Real Life Example:

// You're typing in a search bar:

// 📝 You type: K, Kr, Kri, Krit, Kriti, Kritika

// Without debounce:

// It will search every time you press a letter → 💥 so many API calls!

// With debounce:

// It waits until you stop typing for 1 second

// Then it searches only once ✅
